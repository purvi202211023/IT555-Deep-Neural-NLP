## Word2Vec based Model for peS2o Dataset
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the training of a Word2Vec based model on the peS2o dataset. The dataset consists of research papers from the Computer Science domain.
### Key Features:\n1. **Dataset Selection**: Only research papers from the Computer Science domain are considered.\n2. **Data Split**: A random training dataset of 3000 documents and a test dataset of 1000 documents are used.\n3. **Linguistic Unit**: Sentences are used as the linguistic unit for embedding, meaning we embed entire sentences rather than individual words.\n4. **Pre-processing**: The input context matrix undergoes a thorough cleanup which includes the removal of:\n   - Stopwords\n   - URLs\n   - Bullets\n   - Apostrophes\n   - Hyphens\n   - Enumerations\n   - Numerical-to-text conversion (using `num2words`)\n   - Punctuations\n5. **Initialization of Context Matrix**: The context matrix is initialized using tf-idf based vector modeling.\n\n## Libraries and Dependencies:\n- `num2words`: Used for converting numbers to words.\n- `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stopword removal.\n- `sklearn`: Specifically, the `TfidfVectorizer` is used for tf-idf based vector modeling.\n- `pandas`: For data manipulation.\n- `numpy`: For numerical operations.\n\n## Getting Started:\n1. Install the required libraries:\n```bash\npip install num2words nltk sklearn pandas numpy\n```\n2. Download necessary `nltk` data:\n```python\nimport nltk\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\n```\n3. If you are using Google Colab, you can mount your Google Drive to access the dataset:\n```python\nfrom google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')\n```\n4. Load the dataset and follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model.\n\n## Acknowledgements:\nThe project is based on the peS2o dataset which consists of research papers from the Computer Science domain.\n\n## Contributing:\nIf you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please raise an issue or submit a pull request.\n\n## License:\nThis project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n
